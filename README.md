# Aegean — AI & Cognitive Tools Developer

Hello! I’m **Aegean**, a Python developer building **AI-powered tools, cognitive enhancements, and practical productivity utilities** — especially ones that work well locally and with extensible architecture.

This profile and infrastructure project are dedicated to **NeuroCore & cognition-oriented development**.

## 🚀 What Is NeuroCore?

**NeuroCore** is a modular, extensible interface for connecting to language models and cognitive systems. It’s designed to enable:

- Integration of **local and remote AI modules**
- Construction of **cognitive applications**
- Flexible use across **Python, CLI, and web tools**

It aims to be **open-source infrastructure** for building human-centric AI ecosystems.

## ⭐ Featured Projects

Here are some highlighted projects from this profile:

### 🧠 NeuralBeat  
A **binaural & monaural beat generator** for precise brainwave entrainment and neuro-acoustic experimentation.

### 🗂 NeuralDeck  
Turn documents (PDFs, Word, etc.) into **offline flashcards** using local AI — a great tool for learning and memorization.

### 📊 N1-Engine  
A local-first Python platform focused on **N=1 self-experiment analysis** and rigorous personal metrics.

### ⚙️ NeuroCore  
The core modular system for interacting with **local/remote language models** and building cognitive interfaces.

### 📅 NöbetWizard  
An automated **duty roster generator** built with Streamlit that creates fair schedules and supports export options.
