# Aegean - AI & Cognitive Tools Developer

Hi, I’m **Aegean** - building modular AI systems, cognitive tooling, and local-first intelligence infrastructure.

My works sits at the intersection of :

- Cognitive architecture  
- Agentic AI Frameworks  
- Modular Tool Ecosystems  
- Self-Experimentation & Optimization Systems  
- Experimental Biological Hypothesis Modeling  

---

# 🧠 NeuroCore

**NeuroCore** is my primary long-term project.

It is a **modular cognitive framework** designed to:

- Connect to local and remote LLMs,
- Execute tool-based reasoning,
- Orchestrate agentic flows,
- Support memory systems (including structured belief control),
- Enable visual cognitive programming (future direction).

### Vision

To build:

> A flexible sandbox for designing intelligence workflows.

Think:
- n8n for cognition  
- LangChain without chaos  
- A programmable brain architecture

# 🧩 Active Projects

### 🧠 NeuroCore Framework
Modular agentic framework with tool library, flow control, memory layers, and extensible architecture.

Future roadmap:

- Multi-agent orchestration
- Plugin marketplace

### 🔁 N1-Engine
A local-first system for **N=1 experimentation** and self-quantification.

Designed for:
- Metabolic tracking
- Hormonal optimization modeling
- Experimental protocol logging

### 🎧 NeuralBeat
Precise **binaural & monaural beat generator** for brainwave entrainment experimentation.

### 📚 NeuralDeck
Offline document-to-flashcard system using local AI models.  

### 📅 NöbetWizard
Streamlit-based duty roster optimizer for fair and exportable scheduling.

# 🧬 Research & Intellectual Themes

Some domains I actively explore:

- Obesity Hypothesis Modeling,
- GLP-1 / Incretin Regulation Systems,
- LLM Memory Integrity & Belief Falsification,
- Consciousness Engineering Concepts.

I treat biology, cognition, and computation as interoperable systems.
